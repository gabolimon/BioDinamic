## jQuery lightbox plugin

A basic jQuery lightbox plugin i build to meet my needs after repeatedly building a bespoke lightbox solution on each individual project. The aim with this was to build a lightweight plugin with minimal setup and styling to allow the user to use it in a plug and play environment or as the base for your own project.

The lightbox has currently been built to support 3 types of content:

* YouTube
* Vimeo
* Images
